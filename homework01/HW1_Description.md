PyEx1.py Description
  For the first python exercise I initialized a list variable to have 
  somewhere to input my names. I then put all of the words into that 
  list and made sure to sort the list from longest to shortest. Lastly 
  I just printed the first 5 elements from my list, since they should 
  be the longest 5.


PyEx2.py Description
  In this exercise I made a list to input my names in and then I 
  established a while loop that will contin up to 5 elements.
  I then set a variable to the function call of getting the first 
  name and tested if the name was the length I wanted and if so I 
  added it to my list otherwise it would just continue to iterate
  through the loop.

PyEx2.py Description
  Last but not least I of course imported the names library and 
  created a function to get the length of an inputed value minus 1
  because we don't want to include the space. I then made a for loop
  to run 5 times putting both the full name and length into their own
  respective variables. Finally printing the name and length as a str.
